Teal
====
(Totally Easy API LOL)

Teal is WJRH's Core Data API.

We're building Teal to manage the information from shows. We want to:
- log song, album, artist etc. names
- track shows: both recorded and live

In the future, this core API will help us build our new website, apps on various platforms and let us set our eyes on larger goals.
