Teal
====
(Totally Easy API LOL)

Teal is WJRH's Core Data API.

![](http://wjrh.org/teal_sharpie.jpg)

We're building Teal to manage the information from shows and events WJRH sponsors. We want to:
- collect song, album, artist names as they play on the radio
- keep track of planned and unplanned shows
- manage DJs
- make it easy to discover, add and edit station information.

In the future, this core API will help us build our new website, apps on various platforms and let us set our eyes on larger goals.
