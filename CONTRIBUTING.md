We love pull requests from anyone.

The easiest way to have Teal up and running on your machine is to use Docker. Download the Docker Toolbox for the latest versions of the tools we use.

Fork, then clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:/<YOUR-USERNAME>/Teal.git
```

and simply start all the services we use with Teal.

To find out at which ip address your server is running on, run:

```
docker-machine ip
```	

and then navigate to that ip address to view the tool in action.
