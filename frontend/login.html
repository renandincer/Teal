    <h4>API-first</h4>
    <p>The provided frontend uses the same API that is available to you. You can build your own tools to talk to Teal or automate everything. Scroll below for docs.</p>

<h2>API Documentation</h2>
<h3>Authentication</h3>
<p>Every account is authenticated over email:</p>
<pre>curl -X POST -d '{"email":"&lt;YOUR EMAIL&GT;"}' http://api.teal.cool/login</pre>
<p>or using the shortcut version:</p>
<pre>curl -X POST http://api.teal.cool/login?email=&lt;YOUR EMAIL&GT;</pre>
<p>The login method doesn't return any useful information. Once an email is sent, it will expire in 8 minutes. During this time, you can not request an other authentication email.</p>
<p>When you open your email account you will see an email from login@teal.cool. At this point, you can choose to also login using the frontend. If you do, your key will be accessible at <code>api.teal.cool/key</code> from your browser. Note that every time you request a key, the old one will be invalidated.
<p>You can also choose only to get your key directly:</p>
<pre>curl http://api.teal.cool/auth?token=aZ3vNUb0Rjm7gBK4BeBjgg</pre>
<p>API keys will never expire but every successful login will generate a new one.</p>
